P1
introduction to ML, probabilistic reasoning in uncertain environments
We will cover three major areas in machine learning: ..., ...

P2
Our learning approach will be a mixture of conceptual, theoretical, and practical. We will discuss the motivations behind common probabilistic models, and the properties that determine whether or not such models will work well for a particular task. On the one hand, you will derive the mathematical underspinnings for many common ML approaches, as well as apply those techniques to model real data.

\paragraph{Goals}
After this course, you will be able to...
\begin{itemize}
\item learn how to think in principled ways of modeling (understand the why's)
\item understand deeply how and why machine learning works
\item learn how to regularize models
\item learn how to optimize objective functions
\item learn how to validate
\item deal with data computationally large/small, and statistically small
\end{itemize}

Prerequisites
- know how to program numerical python
- background in stats and simple distributions (although we will review concepts on the way). It is better when you are reviewing concepts than learning it for the first time.
- you should be comfortable with matrix manipulations and (multivariate) calculus.

Students are expected to write non-trivial programs. Code will be provided in python.
Background: basic probability theory, some portions of calculus, and linear algebra. For a review, check: ref.
Programming in Python. Besides this, you should have interest or investment in scientific computing.

\section{Course Logistics}

This is an intensive course of 4h/day for 10 days in total. Each day will be approximately structured as follows:

* Quizz of concepts/correction of homeworks + summary of previous day and questions (30 min)
* Lecture (1h)
* Practical (30 min)
* Break (15 min)
* Lecture (1h)
* Practical (30 min)
* Introduction to Homework (15 min)

\section{Requirements and Grading}
        - homeworks: 30%
        - practicals: 30%, teams of three, open-ended, encourage creativity, involves programming.
        Your main deliverable will be a short report. You’ll be assessed on effort, the sophistication of your technical approach, the clarity of your explanations, the evidence that you present to support your evaluative claims, and the performance of your implementation. A highperforming approach with little explanation will receive little credit, while a careful set of experiments that illuminate why a particular direction turned out to be a dead end may
receive close to full credit.
        - midterms (x2): 20%-20%

Lectures and labs
* (65 pts) X homeworks, maximum of 3 questions: submission as jupyter notebooks, possible to collaborate, submit one homework per group.
* (15 pts) paper presentation
* (17 pts) final exam
* (3 pts) participation

\section{Philosophy}

The goal of this course is to instill a strong technical background for you to responsibly apply machine learning in the world. Thus, in addition to the derivations and the practicals, each class will include a story about real-world applications of machine learning. One full lecture and part of an assignment will be devoted to the ethical implications at the end of the course.
To be blunt: Given the increasing use of machine learning systems, the users and developers of these systems must hold themselves to high professional and ethical standards.
One can cause real harm by pursuing a good cause via poor engineering choices. Quoting one of our favorite superheroes: with great power (to run any kind of analysis)
comes great responsibility (to do it properly)!
Relatedly, we expect all participants in this course—instructors, staff, students—to be
committed to a open, professional, and inclusive environment. Just like the maths, these qualities take cultivation and effort. I will start with the premise that we are all decent people trying our best and encourage constructive feedback to improving the course environment.
